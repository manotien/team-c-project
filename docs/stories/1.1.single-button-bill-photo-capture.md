- Implement device detection for mobile vs desktop
- Store captured image temporarily in component state
- Pass image to US-1.2 OCR processing flow

### Testing

**Test Location:** `__tests__/components/bill-capture/`

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for button component rendering
- Unit tests for camera permission handling
- Unit tests for file upload validation
- Integration test for full capture flow
- E2E test for mobile camera access
- E2E test for desktop file upload

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright/Cypress for E2E tests

**Specific Requirements:**
- Mock camera API for unit tests
- Test permission denial scenarios
