## Dev Notes

### Technical Context

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: Next.js client component (React)
- Form handling: React Hook Form or native state
- API: Next.js API route (`/api/bills`)
- Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (per architecture)

**Integration Points:**

- Previous story (US-1.2): Receives OCR extracted data
- Epic 2 (Task Creation): Bill save triggers automatic task creation
- Epic 8 (Profile & Icons): Bill type icons displayed in dropdown
- Main dashboard: Return destination after save/cancel

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Pre-populate form with OCR results from US-1.2
- Currency format: THB (Thai Baht) with thousand separators
- Bill types: Electric, Water, Internet, Car, Home, Other
- Store original OCR data in `ocrData` JSON field for audit trail
- Required fields: amount, due date
- Optional fields: vendor name, bill type

**Database Schema (Bill Table):**

```sql
- id: UUID primary key
- vendor: TEXT (nullable)
- amount: DECIMAL (required)
- currency: TEXT (default: 'THB')
- dueDate: DATE (required)
- billType: TEXT (nullable)
- imagePath: TEXT
- ocrData: JSON (stores confidence scores and raw response)
- createdAt: TIMESTAMP
- updatedAt: TIMESTAMP
```

**API Request Format:**

```json
POST /api/bills
{
  "vendor": "MEA",
  "amount": 1250.00,
  "currency": "THB",
  "dueDate": "2025-11-15",
  "billType": "Electric",
  "imagePath": "/uploads/receipts/1234567890-abc123.jpg",
  "ocrData": {
    "confidence": { "amount": 0.95, "dueDate": 0.78 },
    "rawResponse": { /* full OCR data */ }
  }
}
```

**Form Validation Rules:**

- Amount: Required, must be positive number, max 2 decimal places
- Due date: Required, must be valid date, can be past or future
- Vendor: Optional, max 100 characters
- Bill type: Optional, must be one of predefined types

**Success Flow:**

1. User submits valid form
2. API creates bill record in database
3. API triggers task auto-creation (Epic 2)
4. Success message displayed
5. Navigate to dashboard showing new bill

### Dependencies

**Epic 2 Integration:** Bill creation must trigger automatic task creation. Coordinate with Epic 2 implementation for task auto-creation hook.

**Epic 8 Integration:** Bill type dropdown should display icons (if available). Fallback to text-only if icons not yet implemented.

### Testing

**Test Location:** `__tests__/components/bill-capture/` and `__tests__/api/bills/`

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for form validation logic
- Unit tests for bill type detection
- Integration tests for bill creation API
- E2E tests for complete bill capture flow
- Test form pre-population with OCR data
- Test empty/null OCR values handling

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests

**Specific Requirements:**
- Test required field validation
- Test amount validation (positive numbers, decimals)
- Test date validation
- Test cancel/discard functionality
- Test success flow with database
- Verify task auto-creation

8. ✅ "Cancel" button discards capture and closes modal (AC-8)
9. ✅ Form validation for required fields (amount, due date) (AC-9)
10. ✅ Success message shown after save (AC-10)

**Additional Features:**
